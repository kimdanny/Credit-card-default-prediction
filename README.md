## Co-working rules
1. Push your intermediate workings in `working` directory with filename `<Methodology>-<your name>.ipynb`. For example, Neuralnets-danny.ipynb   
2. We will work on Final.ipynb file at some point in relay  
3. Path you get data from -> In your ipynb files which will be in `working` directory, always get data from `../data/<filename>`  
4. Maybe you can 'watch' this repository to get notification of changes.
