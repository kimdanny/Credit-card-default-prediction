## Co-working rules
1. Push your intermediate workings in `working` directory with filename `<Methodology>-<your name>.ipynb`. For example, Neuralnets-danny.ipynb . If you want to continue your work based on other's notebook, then feel free to just copy the file and name it differently.  
2. We will work on Final.ipynb file at some point in relay  
3. Path you get data from -> In your ipynb files which will be in `working` directory, always get data from `../data/<filename>`  
4. Maybe you can 'watch' this repository to get notification of changes.
